+ Halloween event is beginning friday at 4 PM!
+ Here's a couple of things I added for it:

+ Trick or treating!
You run g*trickortreat and connect up to a random person who also ran it.
You'll be given 10 seconds to choose if the person should get candy or get chosen to get candy or not.
Candy will be converted to tokens in november.
Learn more on the announcement about the Halloween event (#announcements).

+ Checking your candy with g*candy!

Random stuff now
+ Added g*website that links to the website.
+ Added event messages to Uno.
+ Language now defaults to guild owner's language.

- Fixed not really being able to play after the 9th card by turning the choice into letters.
- Fixed commands erroring for no reason.
- Fixed uno not updating messages some times.
